## APIs to create fine-tuned models

The following APIs can be used to automatically create a fine-tuned model within a specific project. You can find a simple end-to-end example of how to use them [here](https://github.com/OpenPipe/OpenPipe/blob/main/client-libs/typescript/src/tests/createFineTune.test.ts).

- [Create dataset](/api-reference/post-unstabledatasetcreate)
- [Add dataset entries](/api-reference/post-unstabledataset-entrycreate)
- [Create fine-tune](/api-reference/post-unstablefinetunecreate)
- [Check fine-tune status](/api-reference/get-unstablefinetuneget)
