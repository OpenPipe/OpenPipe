Once your request logs are recorded, you can export them at any time. The exported jsonl contains all the data that we've collected from your logged calls, including tags and errors.

### Fields

- **`Input`:** The complete chat creation request.
- **`Output`:** Whatever output was generated, including errors.
- **`Tags`:** Any tags that you included when making the request.

### Example

```jsonl
{"input":{"model":"openpipe:test-tool-calls-ft","tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"get_current_weather","parameters":{"type":"object","required":["location"],"properties":{"unit":{"enum":["celsius","fahrenheit"],"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string","description":"The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"}}},"description":"Get the current weather in a given location"}}],"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"tell me the weather in SF and Orlando"}]},"output":{"id":"c7670af0d71648b0bd829fa1901ac6c5","model":"openpipe:test-tool-calls-ft","usage":{"total_tokens":106,"prompt_tokens":47,"completion_tokens":59},"object":"chat.completion","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":null,"tool_calls":[{"id":"","type":"function","function":{"name":"get_current_weather","arguments":"{\"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}"}},{"id":"","type":"function","function":{"name":"get_current_weather","arguments":"{\"location\": \"Orlando, FL\", \"unit\": \"celsius\"}"}}]},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"created":1702666185703},"tags":{"promptId":"test_sync_tool_calls_ft","$sdk":"python","$sdk.version":"4.1.0"}}
{"input":{"model":"openpipe:test-content-ft","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"count to 3"}]},"output":{"id":"47116eaa9dad4238bf12e32135f9c147","model":"openpipe:test-content-ft","usage":{"total_tokens":38,"prompt_tokens":29,"completion_tokens":9},"object":"chat.completion","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"1, 2, 3"},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"created":1702666036923},"tags":{"promptId":"test_sync_content_ft","$sdk":"python","$sdk.version":"4.1.0"}}
