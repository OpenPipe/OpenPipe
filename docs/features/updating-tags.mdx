title: "Updating Tags"
---

You may want to update the tags on a request log after it's already been reported. For instance, if you notice that a certain completion from your fine-tuned model was flawed,
you can mark it to be imported into one of your datasets and relabeled with GPT-4 for future training.

To update your tags, you'll need to provide two fields: `filters` and `tags`.

### Filters

Use filters to determine which request logs should be updated. Each filter contains two fields, `field` and `equals`.

- **`field`: Required** - Indicates the field on a request log that should be checked. Valid options include `model`, `completionId`, and `tags.your_tag_name`.
- **`equals`: Required** - The value that the field should equal.

Keep in mind that filters are cumulative, so only request logs that match all of the filters you provide will be updated.

### Tags

Provide one or more tags in a json object. The key should be the name of the tag you'd like to add, update, or delete. The value should be the new value of the tag.
If you'd like to delete a tag, provide a value of `None` or `null`.

Updated tags will be searchable in the [Request Logs](/features/request-logs) panel.
