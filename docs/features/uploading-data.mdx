Upload a JSONL file populated with a list of training examples.

Each line of the file should be compatible with the OpenAI [chat format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object), with additional optional fields.

### OpenAI Fields

- **`messages`: Required** - Formatted as a list of OpenAI [chat completion messages](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api). The list should end with an assistant message.
- **`function_call`: Optional** - Just like with OpenAI function calling, you can set this to `{ "name": "your_function_call_name" }` to indicate that the model should be required to call the given function. For more information read OpenAI's [function calling docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling).
- **`functions`: Optional** - An array of functions available for the model to call. If you set the `function_call` argument, the function you asked it to call must be defined here. For more information read OpenAI's [function calling docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling).

You can include other parameters from the OpenAI chat completion input format (eg. temperature), but they will be ignored since they aren't relevant for training.

### Additional Fields

- **`split`: Optional** - One of "TRAIN" or "TEST". If you don't set this field we'll automatically divide your inputs into train and test splits with a target ratio of 80:20.

### Example

```jsonl
...
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant"},{"role":"user","content":"What is the capital of Tasmania?"},{"role":"assistant","content":null,"function_call":{"name":"identify_capital","arguments":"{\"capital\":\"Hobart\"}"}}],"functions":[{"name":"identify_capital","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"capital":{"type":"string"}}}}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant"},{"role":"user","content":"What is the capital of Sweden?"},{"role":"assistant","content":null,"function_call":{"name":"identify_capital","arguments":"{\"capital\":\"Stockholm\"}"}}],"functions":[{"name":"identify_capital","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"capital":{"type":"string"}}}}]}
