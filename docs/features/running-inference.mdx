title: "Running Inference"
---

Once your fine-tuned model is deployed, you're ready to start running inference.

First, make sure you've set up the SDK properly. See the [OpenPipe SDK](/getting-started/openpipe-sdk) section for more details. Once the SDK is installed and you've added the right
`OPENPIPE_API_KEY` to your environment variables, you're almost done.

The last step is to update the model that you're querying to match the ID of your new fine-tuned model.

    model="openpipe:your-fine-tuned-model-id",

Queries to your fine-tuned models will now be shown in the [Request Logs](/features/request-logs) panel.

Feel free to run some sample inference on the [PII Redaction model](https://app.openpipe.ai/p/BRZFEx50Pf/fine-tunes/6076ad69-cce5-4892-ae54-e0549bbe107f/general) in our public project.
