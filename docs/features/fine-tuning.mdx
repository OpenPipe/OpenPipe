Fine-tuning lies at the heart of our platform. Through OpenPipe, you can train, evaluate, and deploy your models all in the same place.

For an example of how an OpenPipe model looks once it's trained, check out our public [PII Redaction](https://app.openpipe.ai/p/BRZFEx50Pf/fine-tunes/6076ad69-cce5-4892-ae54-e0549bbe107f/general) model. Feel free to hit it with some sample queries!
