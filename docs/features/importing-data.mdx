Upload a JSONL file populated with a list of training examples.

Each line of the file should have an input and output key. The input should be an OpenAI [chat completion](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/object), and the output should be formatted as an OpenAI assistant message.

### Input

- **`messages`**: Required. Formatted as a list of OpenAI [chat completion messages](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api).
- **`function_call`**: Optional. Just like with OpenAI function calling, you can set this to `{ "name": "your_function_call_name" }` to indicate that the model should be required to call the given function. For more information read OpenAI's [function calling docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling).
- **`functions`**: Optional. An array of functions available for the model to call. If you set the `function_call` argument, the function you asked it to call must be defined here. For more information read OpenAI's [function calling docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling).

You can include other parameters from the OpenAI chat completion input format (eg. temperature), but they will be ignored since they aren't relevant for training.

### Output

- **`role`**: Must be `assistant` for OpenAI compatibility.
- **`content`** or **`function_call`**: must be set in the same way as OpenAI's [chat completion response format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api).

### Other Fields

- **`split`**: Optional. One of "TRAIN" or "TEST". If you don't set this field we'll automatically divide your inputs into train and test splits with a target ratio of 80:20.
