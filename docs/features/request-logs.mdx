Request logs are a great way to get to know your data. Additionally, you can import directly from request logs into your training datasets. That means it's really easy to train on data you've collected in production.

Check out our [public demo](https://app.openpipe.ai/p/BRZFEx50Pf/request-logs?filterData=%7B%22shown%22%3Atrue%2C%22filters%22%3A%5B%7B%22id%22%3A%221705364430157%22%2C%22field%22%3A%22tags.prompt_id%22%2C%22comparator%22%3A%22%3D%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22pii-redaction%2Fredact%22%7D%5D%7D) to see request logs in action.
