## Step 1: Create your OpenPipe Account

If you don't already have one, create an account with OpenPipe at https://app.openpipe.ai/. You can sign up with GitHub, so you don't need to remember an extra password.

## Step 2: Find your Project API key

In order to capture your calls and fine-tune a model on them, we need an API key to authenticate you and determine which project to store your logs under.

<Note>
  When you created your account, a project was automatically configured for you as well. Find its
  API key at https://app.openpipe.ai/settings.

## Step 3: Integrate the OpenPipe SDK

You're done with the hard part! Learn how to integrate the OpenPipe SDK on the next page.
