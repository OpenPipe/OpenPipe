title: "Installing the SDK"
---

Use the OpenPipe SDK as a drop-in replacement for the generic OpenAI package. We currently support logging OpenAI calls and support for more LLM providers will be added soon.

Find the SDK at https://pypi.org/project/openpipe/

## Simple Integration

Add `OPENPIPE_API_KEY` to your environment variables.

```bash
export OPENPIPE_API_KEY=opk-<your-api-key>
# Or you can set it in your code, as shown in the example below
```

Replace this line

```python
from openai import openai
```

with this one

```python
from openpipe import openai
```

## Adding Searchable Tags

OpenPipe has a concept of "tagging." This is very useful for grouping a certain set of completions together.
When you're using a dataset for fine-tuning, you can select all the prompts that match a certain set of tags. Here's how you can use the tagging feature:

```python
from openpipe import openai, configure_openpipe
import os

# If you have the `OPENPIPE_API_KEY` environment variable set
# we'll read from it by default.
configure_openpipe(api_key=os.getenv("OPENPIPE_API_KEY"))

# Configure OpenAI the same way you would normally
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "count to 10"}],
    openpipe={"tags": {"prompt_id": "counting", "any_key": "any_value"}},
)

```

Find the SDK at https://www.npmjs.com/package/openpipe

## Simple Integration

Add `OPENPIPE_API_KEY` to your environment variables.

```bash
export OPENPIPE_API_KEY=opk-<your-api-key>
# Or you can set it in your code, as shown in the example below
```

Replace this line

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";
```

with this one

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openpipe/openai";
```

## Adding Searchable Tags

OpenPipe has a concept of "tagging." This is very useful for grouping a certain set of completions together.
When you're using a dataset for fine-tuning, you can select all the prompts that match a certain set of tags. Here's how you can use the tagging feature:

```typescript
// Fully compatible with original OpenAI initialization
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "my api key", // defaults to process.env["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
  // openpipe key is optional
  openpipe: {
    apiKey: "my api key", // defaults to process.env["OPENPIPE_API_KEY"]
    baseUrl: "my url", // defaults to process.env["OPENPIPE_BASE_URL"] or https://app.openpipe.ai/api/v1 if not set
  },
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Count to 10" }],
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  // optional
  openpipe: {
    // Add custom searchable tags
    tags: {
      prompt_id: "counting",
      any_key: "any_value",
    },
  },
});
```
